## Notes

For many years now, ISPs deliver a router including an access point. And Wi-fi is integrated into more devices than 
just homes or company LANs. Every mobile phone or tablet has Wi-fi support nowadays. The VoIP infrastructure of some 
supermarket announcements are routed over Wi-fi. Advertising panels in buses, railways and at stations, and even 
surveillance cameras often use Wi-fi as a transport medium.

* Most users should now know that WEP is totally insecure or isnâ€™t even configurable anymore, but on old routers they 
still are configurable and configured.
* The other protocols are also hackable, just not as extremely easy as WEP.
* Wi-fi is cheap, individually deployable and popular and therefore often built into the most unexpected places, blind 
to the associated massive security risks.
* In this evolving industry with ever more devices connected to wireless networks, understanding wireless security 
threats and countermeasures is critical.
