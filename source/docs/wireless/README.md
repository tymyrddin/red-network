# Introduction

## What?

For many years now, ISPs deliver a router including an access point. And Wi-fi is integrated into more devices than 
just homes or company LANs. Every mobile phone or tablet has Wi-fi support nowadays. The VoIP infrastructure of some 
supermarket announcements are routed over Wi-fi. Advertising panels in buses, railways and at stations, and even 
surveillance cameras often use Wi-fi as a transport medium.

Wi-fi is cheap, individually deployable and popular and therefore often built into the most unexpected places, blind 
to the associated massive security risks. In this evolving industry with ever more devices connected to wireless 
networks, understanding wireless security threats and countermeasures is critical.

Hack wireless networks.

## Why?

Evaluate the reach of a wireless network, whether the traffic flowing over that network can be intercepted 
(or influenced) by an adversary and if an attacker can gain access to the wireless network.
