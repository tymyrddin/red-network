## Key trends

* Chosen-Prefix Collisions: Building on the 2017 shattered attack, researchers demonstrated practical attacks where attackers can craft two arbitrary files with the same MD5 hash while controlling large portions of both files.
* GPU Bruteforce: Modern GPUs can test billions of MD5 hashes per second (RTX 4090 achieves ~100 GH/s for simple passwords).
* Cloud-Based Attacks: AWS p4d instances with 8xA100 GPUs can crack most unsalted MD5 hashes of passwords <12 chars in hours.
* Side-Channel: New timing attacks can recover MD5 states 30-40% faster than pre-2018 methods.
* Protocol Exploits: Several implementations still use MD5 in legacy modes (especially in embedded systems) where modern attacks apply.

## Key Defence Trends Against MD5 Exploitation in BGP

* Cryptographic Replacement: 
    * Adoption of TCP-AO replaces MD5 with AES-based CMAC gives stronger integrity and per-packet key derivation to prevent replay attacks
    * IPsec Encapsulation for BGP encrypts all BGP traffic (IKEv2 + ESP). It is mandated in high-security environments (financial/military ASes)
* Operational Hardening: 
    * Strict Key Management: Regular rotation of BGP session keys (even if MD5 is used) and Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for key storage
    * Network Segmentation: BGP speakers placed in isolated management VLANs; Physical access controls for core routers
* Detection & Mitigation:
    * Anomaly Detection Systems: ML-based monitoring of BGP updates (RPKI invalid announcements); Threshold alerts for sudden AS path changes
    * Forensic Readiness: PCAP logging of BGP sessions (post-mortem collision analysis); MD5 hash blacklisting for known malicious prefixes
* Legacy MD5 Mitigations:
    * Salting Where Unavoidable: Router-specific salts for MD5 keys (breaks rainbow tables)
    * Rate-Limited Sessions: Lockout after repeated failed MD5 auth attempts; TCP RST injection for suspicious sessions
* Vendor/Protocol Trends:
    * BGP Software Updates: Disabling MD5 by default (FRRouting 8.0+); Deprecation warnings in Cisco IOS-XE/Junos
    * RPKI Adoption: ROA-based route origin validation (reduces impact of hijacking); ASPA for path validation (draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-10)

## Emerging Defences

* Post-Quantum Signatures: Testing CRYSTALS-Dilithium for BGPsec
* AI-Powered BGP Defences: Real-time collision detection via neural nets
* Hardware Enforced [TCP-AO](tcp-ao.md): Offload to NICs/DPUs for performance
