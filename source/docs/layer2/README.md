# Introduction

## What?

Hacking Layer 2, responsible for addressing packets in an Ethernet with the use of MAC addresses. 

## Why?

* OSI was built to allow different layers to work without knowledge of each other. This means if one layer is hacked, 
communications are compromised without the other layers being aware of the problem.
* Security is only as strong as the weakest link
* And when it comes to networking, layer 2 can be a VERY weak link
