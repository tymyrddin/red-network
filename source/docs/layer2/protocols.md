# Protocols and services

* [Ethernet](https://wiki.wireshark.org/Ethernet), the most common local area networking technology, and, with gigabit and 10 gigabit Ethernet, is also being used for metropolitan-area and wide-area networking.
* [Link layer discovery protocol (LLDP)](https://wiki.wireshark.org/LinkLayerDiscoveryProtocol), commonly used as a component in network management and network monitoring applications.
* [Cisco Discovery protocol (CDP)](https://wiki.wireshark.org/CDP), a Cisco proprietary protocol that support the IEEE 802.1ab version of LLDP, and is primarily used to share information between directly connected Cisco devices.
* [IP route](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip-route.8.html), a command which contains information from the IP routing table that can be used to forward a packet through the best path towards its destination.
* [Forwarding database (FDB) (MAC table)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forwarding_information_base), stores MAC addresses of the discovered devices and their respective ports, and is preferred for discovering switches.
* [Address Resolution protocol (ARP)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc826), maps dynamic IP (Layer 3) with MAC addresses (Layer 2). ARP translates 32-bit addresses to 48-bit and vice versa, and is preferred by IPv4 devices.
* [Multi-link trunking protocol (MLT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-link_trunking), provides a high-speed, fault-tolerant connection between servers, switches and routers by grouping all ethernet links into a single logical ethernet link.
* [Controller area network (CAN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus), facilitates communication between the applications of microcontrollers and their devices without relying on a host computer.
* [Point-to-Point protocol (PPP)](https://wiki.wireshark.org/PPP.md), can establish communication between two routers without the help of a host.
