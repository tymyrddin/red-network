## Notes

BGP hijacking happens often, there's no practical way to prevent it, we have to live with it. Internet routing was designed to be a conversation between trusted parties. HTTPS encryption is backed by SSL/TLS PKI, which itself trusts Internet routing. Routing announcements are accepted practically without any validation, creating the possibility of a network operator announcing someone else's network prefixes without permission. Testing has shown that sending spoofed updates as a blind adversary is more difficult than thought, while launching this attack from a compromised/misconfigured router turned out relatively easy.

A BGP hijack can be used to disable critical portions of the Internet by disrupting Internet routing tables, force a multi-homed AS to use an alternate path to/from an outside network instead of the preferred path, disable single-homed and multi-homed AS, to blackhole traffic and in MitM attacks.
