# Introduction

## What?

Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is probably the most known protocol of the Internet. There are information 
sites, shopping portals, search engines, e-mail and forum services, office software, wikis, blogs, calendars, 
social networks, chat software, e-government applications etc., all HTTP-based. 
It is so dominant that many people even think HTTP (or the WWW) ***is*** the Internet. 

## Why?

* Most attacks nowadays are aimed at web applications, and web browsers are one of the favourite attack tools. 
* Enough reasons to have a deeper look at the security of the web in these directions.
