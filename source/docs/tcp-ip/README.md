# Introduction

## What?

Hacking the heart of the Internet.

## Why?

* Despite attempts to make TCP as secure as possible, there still are some attacks that abuse it.
* Three major attacks are possible: Address spoofing, TCP sequence number prediction, and port scanning.
* And several minor attacks.
