# Introduction

## What?

Sniffing, analysing and inspecting packets, and forging and decoding packets.

## Why?

An Nmap port scan may show a host as down or all of the ports as "filtered". Analysing and inspecting 
packets over the network can help provide some insight as to what is going on with the connection attempts.

## How?

* [PCAP files](pcap.md)
* [Sniffing](sniffing.md)
* [Forging and decoding packets](forging.md)
