[SSL BEAST](https://nerdoholic.org/uploads/dergln/beast_part2/ssl_jun21.pdf) (Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS) is an 
attack developed by Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong, that leverages weaknesses in cipher block chaining (CBC) to exploit 
the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. The CBC vulnerability can enable man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks against 
SSL in order to silently decrypt and obtain authentication tokens, providing hackers with access to the data passed 
between a Web server and the Web browser accessing the server.
