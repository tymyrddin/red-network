## Notes

Bluejacking transmits data to a device without the knowledge of the user. This attack can be done by sending an 
electronic business card via Bluetooth to a target. Instead of putting a real name in the name field, insert a message.

Bluejacking is not inherently malicious, but takes a dark turn when used for sending phishing scams, or files that 
intend to hack or damage the device.
