## What?

Hacking DNS or Domain Name System is like hacking the telephone book of the internet or intranet. 

## Why?

DNS offers a simple and silent variant of the man-in-the-middle attack. Most of the time you only have to spoof a 
single DNS response packet to hijack all packets of a connection.
